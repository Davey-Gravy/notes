# Synopsis

I have never heard an artist with the songwriting, personality, pen game, and raw talent like JID. The Atlanta-based rapper was known early on as "just a fast rapper", someone who can spit rhymes fast like Eminem or Busta Rhymes. I can't disagree with this sentiment enough. While JID does have songs where he just goes machine gun mode like Off Deez and Meditate, he has the ability to slow down and show off his pipes on tracks like Workin Out and All Bad. 

Although I do not remember exactly when I was put onto JID or which exact song was my first, but Never and 151 Rum were among the first. On both these songs, his style is apparent; his cadence and flow changes constantly, his bars are fire without being corny, he uses literary devices extensively, including alliteration, metaphor, motifs, similes, and many more. If you sit down and look at the lyrics, you'll know that he has something of substance to say and share. While he does talk his shit a good amount, there are still nuggets of lyricism where you can sit and think deeply for a moment.

This description alone would describe those at the top of the food chain, like Kendrick Lamar, MF DOOM, Andre 3000, and more. While JID exhibits qualities from each of these artists, I believe he has a level of musicality that goes beyond those aforementioned.

The primary separator from JID and other rappers is his singing ability, which is front and center on Kody Blu 31 from his latest album The Forever Story. While the vast majority of his songs do not involve singing to the extent of Kody Blu, he uses vocal inflections and pitch in much of his rapping like Kendrick and Andre do. The thing is, Kendrick and Andre really aren't good singers in my opinion. JID's voice is smooth like butter while singing and rapping.
