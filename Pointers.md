- What are pointers?
	- A variable
		- value is an address to memory *pointing* to another variable or function
- When to use pointers?
	- Want full control of hardware in critical applications
		- allocate/deallocate memory
	- Can access data outside scope of function
	- Efficient array operations
	- Dynamic memory allocation on the heap
		- memory doesn't have variable name, only accessible via pointer
	- Enables [[Polymorphism | polymorphism]] for [[Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)| OOP]]
	- Accessing specific addresses in memory
		- useful in embedded applications
