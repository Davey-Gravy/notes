# Machine Learning

> The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
> 
> -- <cite>Arthur Samuel (1959)</cite>

> A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$

## Key Elements

1. Representation
	- How is the data represented?
2. Evaluation
	- What is the measure of performance?
3. Optimization
	- How can the performance be maximized?
4. Experimentation
	- Application of scientific method to multiple approaches
