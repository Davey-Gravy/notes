Density ratio between an object and a fluid

$$
\text{Specific Gravity} = \frac{\rho_\text{object}}{\rho_\text{water}}
$$

$$
\rho_\text{water}=1000\,\text{kg\,m}^{-3}
$$

Denotes fraction of a floating objecting submerged underwater
- an object made of a material with a specific gravity of 0.2 will have 20% of its volume underwater
