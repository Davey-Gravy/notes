***F***ield ***P***rogrammable ***G***ate ***A***rray

Built from logic cells

Organized into logic blocks

Create digital logic circuits

Essentially a prototyping [[ASIC]]

When to use FPGA instead of microcontroller or making own chip?

- high data throughput
- digital signal processing (DSP)
- custom
- reconfigurable
- speed for specific computations

Programmed using [[HDL]]
