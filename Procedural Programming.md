Focus on process or actions a program takes

- Typically collection of functions
- Data declared separately
- Data passed as arguments into functions

# Limitations

- Functions need to know structure of data
	- If structure changes, functions need to change
- Larger programs are more
	- difficult to
		- understand
		- maintain
		- extend
		- debug
		- reuse
	- fragile
