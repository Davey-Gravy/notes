# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)


**Ordinary** - involves only *one* independent variable

$$
\frac{dy}{dt}+2ty=0
$$

(see [[Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)]])

## First Order ODEs

**First Order** - derivatives of degree one

#### Solution Methods
- [[Method of Separation]]
- [[Method of Integrating Factors]]

## Higher Order ODEs

### Homogeneous

A combination of $y$ and its derivatives that sum exactly to zero:

$$
\alpha_n\frac{d^ny}{dt^n}+\alpha_{n-1}\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dt^{n-1}}+\dots+\alpha_1\frac{dy}{dt}+\alpha_0y=0
$$

#### Solution Methods

- Finding roots of the [[Characteristic Equation|characteristic equation]]

### Non-homogeneous

This type of equation is generally organized as:

$$
ay''+by'+cy=f(t)
$$
