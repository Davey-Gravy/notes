# Newton's Laws of Motion
## First Law

Inertia

> An object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion, unless affected by an external force
>	
> $$
> \sum\vec{F}=0
> $$

## Second Law
Force

> The sum of forces on an object is equal to change in momentum per unit time	
>
> $$
> \sum\vec{F}=\frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt}=m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=ma
> $$

## Third Law

Action and Reaction

> A force by one object on another object has an equal and opposite reaction on the first object
