# Conservative Vector Field

## Definition

> A vector field $\vec{F}$ is *conservative* on an  open domain if 
> $$
> \int_C\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}
> $$
> is the same for all paths $C$ between points $A$ and $B$ in  the domain

- The integral is ***independent of the path*** between endpoints
