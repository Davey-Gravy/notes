As opposed to [[Procedural Programming]]

Revolves around [[Classes]] and [[Objects]]

- Classes model real-world domain entities
- Allow higher level of abstraction
- Successful in large programs
	- Complexity outpaces ability of developers to understand program as it grows
	- Abstraction hides complexity


Reusability

- Easier reuse classes in other applications
- Faster development

# Concepts

- [[Classes]]
	- [[Class Methods]]
- [[Constructors]]
- [[Destructors]]
- [[Encapsulation]]
- [[Inheritance]]
- [[Methods]]
- [[Objects]]
- [[Polymorphism]]

# Limitations

- Does not make bad code better
	- Not suitable for all problems
- More upfront design needed
- Steep learning curve
	- especially for [[C++]]
	- different implementations across languages
- Unchecked, programs can be
	- larger
	- more complex
	- slower
