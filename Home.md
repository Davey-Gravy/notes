Welcome to my Digital Den! I decided to invest in the Publish service to further encourage my self-study and to share my notes with the world. 

I am far from being an Obsidian guru, so excuse my format, theme, and other personal choices. I hope to get some proper CSS made for this, but no promises on that.

# About Me

Please call me Davey; professionally, I am a 23 year-old mechanical engineering graduate attempting to expand my software and electrical engineering abilities while simultaneously improving my [[Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)|CFD]] skills. Having recently started a position at Ansys Inc., these subjects were not picked randomly. Ultimately, I would like my career to focus in either the semiconductor or renewable energy fields, where I can apply my CFD knowledge and experience.

To supplement my self-learning, I plan to enroll in a graduate program to earn my MS, and perhaps consider PhD studies if things turn out that way.

In leisure, I don't think I'm too different from most my age; I enjoy following and participating in sports, particularly basketball, cycling, and soccer. I'm an avid music fan of all genres, though most especially EDM, hip-hop (rap + R&B), and hyperpop/punk. 

I'll list some quick current artist recs for those interested:
- EDM
	- Porter Robinson
	- Madeon
	- Jai Wolf
	- San Holo
- Hip-hop
	- Dreamville (label)
		- [[JID]](!!!)
		- Earthgang
		- Smino
	- Amin&eacute;
	- Denzel Curry
	- Saba
- Hyperpop/punk
	- Aries
	- brakence
	- tsubi club

In my younger days, I was a huge gamer, having logged thousands of hours into the Battlefield series, NBA 2K, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Destiny 1 and 2, and various other games.

Nowadays my free time is dedicated more towards fitness and self-improvement. I recently bought a 2021 Scott Addict 10 Disc and subscribed to [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/) to build my [[FTP]] and hopefully start chasing Strava KOMs. My real reason for doing this is to build an endurance fitness foundation to cycle in national parks, which typically have tough climbs. I was an All-State 400m runner in high school, but my long distance performance is pitiful, and I would like to improve my fitness.

Ideologically and philosophically, I try to keep an open mind to the infinitude of idaas out there, while simultaneously taking them with a grain of salt. This combination has labeled me as a conservative, a liberal, a centrist, and everything in between. I agree with principles presented in communism, liberalism, anarchism, and many other ideologies. In general, I try to avoid strict ideology and use my personal experience as a basis instead. 

I prefer the realm of hard sciences to soft sciences, which is why I'm an engineer, but observing the polarized discourse of soft sciences like sociology, economics, politics and such frustrates me, and I wish I could do something about it. If I could, I would just be another voice in the reactionary Twitterverse so I just opt out of that. It is apparent to me that the primary issues humanity faces belong to the soft sciences, as our technology enables us to provide plenty at home and bring us to the stars.

Once I learn the optimal way to use this site as a blog, I would like to start blogging, but until then I will use this site as a simple vault.
