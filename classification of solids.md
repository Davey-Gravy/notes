1. Amorphous
	- random 
2. Poly-crystalline
	- local uniform arrangements
3. Crystalline (or single crystal)
	- uniform structure
	- predominantly used in semiconductors

Amorphous and poly-crystalline semiconductors have applications in thin-film transistors used in LCDs

Crystal = [[Bravais Lattice]] + [[basis]]

![[crystal_basis.png]]

Two-atom basis allows
- Diamond structure
	- two of the same atom
- Zinc blende structure
	- same structure as diamond
	- two different atoms
- Wurtzite structure
	- hexagonal bravais lattice
