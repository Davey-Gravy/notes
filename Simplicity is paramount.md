	- multiple people tried, failed
	- only feasible after vertical integration
	- perspective of shipper does not matter, only the root issue of transporting from point A to point B

	- made shipping cheaper -> increase volume
- Classic [[S-type Loonshot|S-type loonshot]]
	- created new indusstry
- not organized by category/type of product
