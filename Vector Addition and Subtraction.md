# Addition

Three primary methods
1. Parallelogram law
	- two vectors can be added by creating a parallelogram from them
	- the resulting diagonal is the sum of the vectors
2. Tip-to-tail
	- place the tail of one vector onto the tip of the other one
	- the sum is given by the line connecting the tail of the first vector and the tip of the second vector
3. Vector decomposition
	- break the vectors into their Cartesian components, then sum together

Vector addition is ***associative***:

$$
\vec{a}+\vec{b}=\vec{b}+\vec{a}
$$

# Subtraction

Subtraction of vectors is simply the addition of a negative component

In the cases of (1) and (2) above, simply reverse the direction of the vector you intend on subtracting and proceed
