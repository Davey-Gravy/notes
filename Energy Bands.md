Quantum theory states that electrons in an atom exist at discrete energies (quantization of energy)

wavefunction corresponding to atomic energy levels known as atomic orbitals

Formation of molecules
- When two hydrogen atoms are brought close together
	- atomic energy levels split
	- molecular orbitals formed
