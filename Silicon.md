# Silicon
- formally a semiconductor, acts like a metal especially in liquid form
- second most common element in Earth's crust (as SiO<sub>2</sub>)

## Types
### Metallurgical grade (MG-Si)
- Si content ~99%
- produced in submerged arc furnace
	#### Uses
	- alloying of aluminum --> 41%
	- silicones --> 355
	- solar-grade Si production --> 12%
	- electronics --> 3%
- 5x increase over past 20 years (mostly China)
- energy mix over 50% renewable
### Ferrosilicon (FeSi)
- mixture of iron and silicon (50-95% Si)
- similar process to MG-Si production
- focus of Icelandic smelters
	#### Uses
	- Carbon, stainless steel production
