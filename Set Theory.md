# Set Theory
A ***set*** is a collection of individual items called *elements* or *members* 

If $A$ and $B$ are two sets, $A$ is a ***subset*** of $B$ if all members of $A$ are in $B$. If $B$ consists of other elements than those in $A$, then $A$ is a ***proper*** subset.

$$
A\subseteq B\quad (\text{subset})

$$
A\subset B \quad (\text{proper subset})
