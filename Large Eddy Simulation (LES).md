# Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
Flow separated into large eddies (dependent on geometry) and smaller eddies (universal throughout flow)

- Large eddies resolved explicitly
- Small eddies resolved implicitly using a sub-grid scale model

Large and small eddies separated using a filtering kernel (explict filtering) or the computational gird (implicit filtering)
