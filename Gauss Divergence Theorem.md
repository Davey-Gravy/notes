# Gauss Divergence Theorem

Also known as the Divergence Theorem or Gauss's Theorem

Converts a volume integral into a surface integral

The volume integral of the divergence of a field variable is equal to the surface integral of the face normal component of that field variable:

$$
\int_V\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{F}\,dV=\int_S\boldsymbol{F}\cdot\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}\,dS
$$
