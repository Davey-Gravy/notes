# Chapter 5

Zettlekasten manual:

1. Bibliographical
	- literature notes
	- index cards stored in boxes
	- references on one side
	- notes on the other
2. Personal
	- one side of letter paper
		- forces condensing of idea
		- can create extended notes
	- idea generation
		- focus on connection w/ other contexts
	- reactions
	- stream of consciousness
- Not a personal Wikipedia
- Compensates for limitation of brain

# Chapter 6

If large enough, can be `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+v` to create a rough draft

- String ideas into text
- Don't worry about editing
	- done later
- Importance of externalizing ideas
	- ensures understanding of concepts

# Chapter 7
*What do you need to do?*

Has focus on research, writing papers

Steps:
1. Take [[Fleeting Notes|fleeting notes]]
	- write on anything, anywhere
	- process later
	- can even be a zettlekasten entry
2. Make [[Literature Notes|literature notes]]
	- notes about content, source
	- things i'd forget, use in own thinking/writing
	- use own words, selective
		- even more so about quotes
		- use bibliographical notes for that
3. [[Permanent Notes|Permanent notes]]
	- compile fleeting + literature notes
		- literature notes become bibliography notes
	- think about connections to current tasks
		- use other entries as basis
	- write as if writing for someone else
		- academic
4. Add permanent notes to zettlekasten
	- file behind related notes
		- software usually does this
	- add link to index map of content
5. Perform research within the system
	- note what's missing, what questions
	- read more to fill holes
	- add notes that inspire me
	- use instead of brainstorming
	- is a growing, living thing
6. Continue editing notes into drafts
	- notice if opinions change, further insights developed in processs
7. Proofread, continue

Take notes regardless of relevance to current project/task

# Chapter 8
*What do you need to have?*

[[Space Pen]]
- demonstrates importance of simplicity

discussion of methods
- of taking notes
	- margins, circling, shapes, highlighting, etc.
- journals
- apps

Ensure your workflow works

Good tools != good workflow

Zettlekasten is a store of objective information
	- more difficult for brain to store long-term

# Chapter 9
[website](takesmartnotes.com)

Four tools:
1. [[Something to write with, write on]]
2. [[Somewhere to record references]]
3. [[Zettlekasten]]
4. Editor

# Chapter 10
> "Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them"

- Tools require meaningful thought and use if utility is to be derived

# Chapter 11
The 4 Underlying Principles
1. [[Writing is the only thing that matters]]

# Chapter 12
2. [[Simplicity is paramount]]

System for deliberately searching for information
- Students + academics take notes like antiquated, pre-Maclane shippers
	- handle ideas in ways that make immediate sense
	- underline interesting senses
	- margin notes
- Requires brain to remember where/when notes were written down
- Text conceptualized independently from the notes
	- Brainstorming after the fact instead of thinking in the moment

Zettlekasten
- System for ideas we have already forgotten
	- rewrite notes
	- reference them when work reminds me of something

“What topic does this note belong to?” → “What context do I want to stumble upon this note in?”
- Use of links allows discovery of applications in different contexts
- Brain does initial work of finding first note
- [[Zettlekasten]] reacquaints us w/ ideas already forgotten
- Brain focuses on *thinking* instead of *remembering*
- [[Zettlekasten]] is shipping container of the academic world
	- different ideas not compartmentalized

Don't focus on in-between steps
- highlighting
- underlining
- excerpt writing

Focus on insight that can be published
- connections
- questions

Becomes more valuable over time as notes are added
- remember [[garbage in, garbage out]]

Carrying around a notebook
- Pro
	- nothing is left unrecorded
- Cons
	- [[Fleeting Notes|fleeting notes]] are treated as [[Permanent Notes|permanent]]
		- critical mass never reached, becomes messy
		- ideas diluted by other notes
	- strict-chronological order
		- no way to shuffle pages

Separate these notes
1. [[Fleeting Notes]]
2. [[Permanent Notes]]
3. [[Project Notes]]

Importance of same format

Don't focus on projects when taking notes
- counter-intuitive
	-  would think that focusing on project would be more productive
