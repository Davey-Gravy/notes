Maybe what's happening with humanity is a culture war. It's almost like the complexity of what humans can be grows exponentially by the day. "Boomers" just don't want to see their culture dying out. They're basically the last o their ind, indoctrinated by their own beliefs as everyone is.

And everyone is "indoctrinated" to some extent. Perhaps with the world gaining mass access to the internet, all the atrocities of what a human can be are available for everyone to see and perpetuating the patriarchy and is going to be called out. As kids we were "indoctrinated" by being told to be nice to others, not be racist, and not be a dick.

It seems like some people (cultures) like to be dicks and that's not gonna stand if humanity is going to have a chance. What this generation has built into them is inclusion and love (in most cases) and apparently that's too hard to do. It's almost like everyone knows that humanity fucked up, and now there's a huge mess lying before us.

We live in the ultra-materialistic dystopia portrayed in many works and since we din't pay heed to Reason, we are being eliminated. To refute the asterisk, I will say in the age of Reason.

We have had millions of rational thinkers who could have thought of this demise for humanity, and computers now that predict the demise of humanity, and the human race is in denial. Perhaps this is what is causing the tribalist reactions around the world. Everyone is picking sides before the ultimate showdown.

This doesn't make sense with the actions of nations around us. Russia clearly wants something on the global scale if they're orchestrating attacks on American democracy to advance their goals. It could be as simple as beef, but I guess us fucking peasants will never know, all we know is that we might not be alive in 30 or even 20 years. If climate change doesn't kill us, the fucking collapse of society once a true war erupts will. I would say America is absolutely not prepared for catastrophe.

We are sucking our natural resources dry when could've gone fully renewable, especially if industrialization developed specifically for sustainable means.

Look at the sheer amount of shit we have produced, a large amount of it useless. This seems so contrary to what I was taught; to turn off the lights when I leave the room, to not have the water running if I'm not immediately using it, to only use shit when I need to. Maybe we're all ignoring that fucker in our head, the voice Reason, of wisdom, and perhaps there will be a moment in my life where I choose between Reason and Desire.

It is impossible to think about that at all times, but there's always so much in the human experience to get lost in. My entire night could become consumed by learning random shit. Is the correct choice action or passivity? I'd say the passive are more curious.. I personally don't think exposing myself to the greater attention of the world is a great idea, and that steers me away from aciton. I am very tempted to act though. I would like to earn my own keep before I do so, as is tradition, because what so many people lack is credentials. Proof of shit. i would love to march with everyone, but old people do not respect us. It's almost like we have to earn the right to sway their opinion. I can come to terms with that. I would like to be a voice of Reason, regardless of my position, and if Reason finds me wrong, then so be it.

I just know something is going to happen in m lifetime, and I would like to be able to contribute to those I love and my community. The ultimate conspiracy would be that Russia is actually in charge of Europe, and trying to convince
