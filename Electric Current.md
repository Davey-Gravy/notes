# Definition

Transfer of electrons through a conductor

- Denoted as $I$
- Units of *amperes* ($A$)
	- A current of $1\text{ A}$ maintained in two parallel, infinitely long conductors with negligible cross-section will produce a force of $2\times10^{-7}\text{ N/m}$
	- $1\text{ C} = 1\text{ A}\cdot\text{s}$
