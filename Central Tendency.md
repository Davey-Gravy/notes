Fancy term for average

# Mean (Arithmetic)

## Sample

The mean calculated from a subset of the population of size $n$

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i
$$

## Population

The population mean is the mean of all observations of the population with size $N$

$$
\mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i
$$

Can be skewed by ***outliers*** -- data points that are not representative of the set and influence the mean

# Median

The middle value of a dataset if it is odd-sized. If the set is even-sized, the median is the average of the two middle values.

$$
\text{Median}(X)=\begin{cases}X\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)& n \text{ odd}\\\frac{X\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)+X\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)}{2}&n\text{ even}\end{cases}
$$

# Mode

The most common value in a dataset
