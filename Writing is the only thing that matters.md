As students, we are used to writing as the preparation for and performance of examinations
- Demonstrate learning and ability to think critically
- Associated with independent research
	- separate from other contexts
	- academica
- Treated as procedure

> "Studying does not preparie students for independent research - *it is independent research*"
- gaining unexpected insight
- sharing with the public

> "There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia; an idea kept private is as good as a fact you never had - and a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all."

The truth is *public* (not always)

> The professor is not there for the student, and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter.
> 
> - Wilhelm von Humboldt

The university's aim is publication

- academic papers
- presentation handouts

Reading, listening is source of writing

Developing actual, open questions about the material
* this is what is worth writing about

Develop ability to distinguish b/w good-sounding arguments and *actually* good ones
- make connections w/ previous knowledge, beliefs
- cannot rephrase things if we don't know what it's about
- creating something new



Deliberate practice is the only way to improve
