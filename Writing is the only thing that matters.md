As students, we are used to writing as the preparation for and performance of examinations
- Demonstrate learning and ability to think critically
- Associated with independent research
	- separate from other contexts
	- academica
- Treated as procedure

> "Studying does not preparie students for independent research - *it is independent research*"
- gaining unexpected insight
- sharing with the public

> "There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia; an idea kept private is as good as a fact you never had - and a fact no one can reproduce is not a fact at all."

The truth is *public* (not always)

> The professor is not there for the student, and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter.
> 
> - Wilhelm von Humboldt

The university's aim is publication
