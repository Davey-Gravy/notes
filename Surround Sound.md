# Chorus

Covers all the bases for a rap/hip-hop single

## Drugs

"Push the fucking pack off of the porch or break a pound down"
- deliver packs of cocaine or break down a pound of cocaine

## Guns

"Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds"
- strap = gun
- he's aware of its power
	- "some round sounds" double entendre

## Sex

"Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down"
- blowjob
- flip of downtown
- play on "going to town"

## Money (almost??)

"Puttin rap on my back and I'm black and snatchin' crowns"
- more about his critical success rather than commerical success

## Overall

Crazy flip on the Aretha Franklin sample
- Homage to Ms. Fat Booty by Mos Def
	- featured on Stars

Varied delivery
- changes pitch, voice inflection
- length of syllables

Followed the beat this time...
- syllables land on the hi-hats



# First verse (JID)

Homecoming. talking his shit 

> I done came back around like a n----- sellin' crack in pounds
> I got a bag now but it's nothing to brag 'bout

- Pounds as weight, or currency
	- insane amount of money
- his music *is* the crack?
- Bag = money
	- he doesn't care about it?
		- busy with making more
	- he expected it?
	- not that big?

but telling us he lives in the *hood*

> Gun blast in the background
> I'm a black man with the bloodhounds
> MAC-10, making love sounds

Transitions into sex

> To a bad chick, she from Uptown
> I'm from down South, not a loudmouth
> We can fuck around (Woah, shit, woah)
> Hit the music, baby, cut it down (Woah, shit, woah)
> Hit a doobie while you do me indubitably
> I feel like I'ma bust now (Woah, woah, shit, woah)

- bad = hot
- Uptown
	- built on a hill, associated with richer neighbourhoods
- South 
	- two most violent neighborhoods in ATL are in the South
		- Oakland City
		- Lakewood Heights
- not a loudmouth
	- he's not violent
	- introversion
- indubitably *technically* makes sense as a sentence, seems to be done for the rhyme rather than deeper meaning

Does a play on the last line to transition to success again

> I feel like a bust down when I shine bright
> Blind n----s is up now (Woah, shit, woah, shit)

- bust down - watch taken apart to inset jewels
- shines so bright 

> In the cut, big black truck, pack sacked up 
> You can pick it up now, n-----, fuck it"

- Also a reference to an unreleased JID song called "Big Black Truck"

Doesn't feel like a typical JID verse
- usually has more to say on a deeper level
- still
	- talking his shit
	- crazy wordplay
	- flow switches

# Second verse (21)

Money theme

# Third verse (JID)

Beat switch, slowing it down

More talking his shit, more JID-y

First line:
> Sorry in advance for my bros

Talking to his fellow rappers
"sorry guys, I'm about to end your careers"
I don't think he was satisfied with his first verse

Mike Alstott
- wore 40, fullback
	- one of the last full-time fullbacks
- preceded by Alzheimer's
	- CTE, fullbacks take heavy hits

## Motifs

### Monopoly

> We on the block, we own they block
> It's Monopoly games, we stole they properties

- Monopoly
	- board game involving buying and sellling blocks of property
		- you move your piece on squares (blocks)
	- IRL they are taking over people's property
	- JID is taking over the rap game

### Billiards

> The same lil' n----s small pond, but a pool shark
> I aim, big stick, knock, chalk off cue balls

- A shark in a small pond
- Pool shark (hustler) - someone who runs the tables purely to earn money 
- Big stick
	- gun
	- Teddy Roosevelt reference
		- "Speak softly, and carry a big stick"
		- trust buster, goes back to Monopoly motif
